		<h1>About Kara</h1>
		<h2>...Not in Kansas Anymore...</h2>

		<p>I'm a born and bred Kansan but after 23 years in the beautiful Flint Hills, I caught the wanderlust bug and needed to get out.</p>

		<p>I moved to Austin and explored the area to see what Texas was all about. Definitely a fun city and everyone should at least visit but I decided it wasn't for me and was ready to move on to somewhere else!</p>

		<p>Now I'm living in Denver and loving it! My dog is certainly enjoying all the fun outdoor activities as well. You're probably wondering if I named her Toto but no, it's Maisy! She's never seen snow so that'll be a "we're not in Texas anymore" moment for her, I'm sure.</p>
